## chapter 2: program structure

### expressions

- fragments of code that produce a value.
- examples: `42`, `"hello, world!"`, `2 + 2`.

### statements

- pieces of code that perform an action.
- examples: `let x = 10;`, `console.log("hello, world!");`.

### variables

- named storage for values.
- declared with `let`, `const`, or `var`.
- example: `let age = 30;`

### bindings

- another term for variables.
- they "bind" or "point" to a value.

### constants

- variables that cannot be changed after they are initialized.
- declared with `const`.
- example: `const pi = 3.14159;`.

### functions

- named sequences of code that can be invoked with arguments and return a value.
- example: `math.max(2, 4);` returns `4`.

### control structures

- code constructs that allow for conditional execution or looping.
- examples: `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`.

### conditional execution

- executing code based on a condition.
- example: `if (x > 10) { console.log("x is greater than 10"); }`.

### loops

- repeating a block of code multiple times.
- examples: `for`, `while`.

### for loop

- a loop that iterates a specific number of times.
- example: `for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { console.log(i); }`.

### while loop

- a loop that continues until a condition is false.
- example: `while (x < 10) { x++; }`.

### comments

- notes in code that are not executed.
- single-line comments: `// this is a comment.`
- multi-line comments: `/* this is a
multi-line comment. */`
