## introduction

- npm is the default package manager for the node.js runtime environment
- allows developers to easily share, reuse, and manage packages (modules) of code
- provides a registry where packages can be published and discovered by others

## installing npm

- npm is automatically installed with node.js, so just download and install the latest version of node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/)

## using npm

- `npm init`: initializes a new project and creates a `package.json` file to manage dependencies and project metadata
- `npm install <package-name>`: installs a package and adds it to the `dependencies` section in `package.json`
  - add the `--save-dev` flag to install the package as a development dependency
  - add the `--global` flag to install the package globally on the system
- `npm uninstall <package-name>`: uninstalls a package and removes it from `package.json`
- `npm update`: updates all packages to their latest compatible versions according to the specified version ranges in `package.json`
- `npm outdated`: lists outdated packages with information about the current, wanted, and latest versions
- `npm ls`: lists installed packages and their dependencies
- `npm run <script-name>`: runs an npm script defined in the `scripts` section of `package.json`
- `npm publish`: publishes a package to the npm registry (requires an npm account and being logged in via `npm login`)

## package.json

- a JSON file that contains important project metadata and manages dependencies
- fields:
  - `name`: the name of the project (must be unique within the npm registry)
  - `version`: the current version of the project, following semantic versioning (semver)
  - `description`: a short description of the project
  - `main`: the entry point file for the project (e.g., `index.js`)
  - `scripts`: an object containing custom scripts that can be run using `npm run <script-name>`
  - `dependencies`: an object containing the names and version ranges of the project's dependencies
  - `devDependencies`: an object containing the names and version ranges of the project's development dependencies

## development vs regular dependencies

- development dependencies: only needed during development and not required for the application to run in production (e.g., testing, building, linting, or transpiling tools)
- regular dependencies: required for the application to function properly during runtime, both in development and production environments (e.g., frameworks, utility libraries, middleware)

## updating the application version

- follow the semantic versioning (semver) scheme: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
  - major: incremented when breaking changes are introduced
  - minor: incremented when new features are added in a backward-compatible manner
  - patch: incremented when backward-compatible bug fixes are made
- update the version number manually in `package.json` or use the `npm version` command:
  - `npm version patch`: update the patch version
  - `npm version minor`: update the minor version
  - `npm version major`: update the major version

## package-lock.json

- automatically generated by npm when installing packages
- ensures consistent package installation across different environments
- contains the exact version and dependency tree of installed packages

## semantic versioning (semver)

- a versioning scheme used by npm to manage package versions
- format: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
  - major: incremented when breaking changes are introduced
  - minor: incremented when new features are added in a backward-compatible manner
  - patch: incremented when backward-compatible bug fixes are made

## managing private packages

- npm offers private packages and scoped packages for managing private code
- requires a paid npm subscription

## npm security

- npm includes built-in security features such as:
  - `npm audit`: analyzes the project's dependencies and reports known security vulnerabilities
  - `npm audit fix`: attempts to automatically fix reported security vulnerabilities by updating or configuring affected packages
- always verify the credibility and safety of third-party packages before installing and using them in a project
